Scientific Calculator
This project is a web-based scientific calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with advanced mathematical functions and operations beyond those typically found in basic calculators.

Features
Advanced Functions: The calculator includes a wide range of advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, ln), exponentiation, factorial, and more.
Expression Evaluation: Users can input complex mathematical expressions, and the calculator will evaluate them accurately using the proper order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
Memory Functions: The calculator supports memory functions such as storing and recalling values, enabling users to perform multi-step calculations without losing intermediate results.
Unit Conversion: Additional features include unit conversion capabilities for common scientific units such as degrees to radians and vice versa.
Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it displays properly on different screen sizes and devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
Customizable Layout: The layout and appearance of the calculator are customizable, allowing developers to adjust colors, fonts, and button placement to suit their preferences or integrate it seamlessly into their applications.
Usage
To use the Scientific Calculator, clone this repository to your local machine and include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project. Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the calculator interface. Users can input mathematical expressions using the on-screen buttons or their keyboard.
